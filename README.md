# Task-2-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-
# Titanic Data Analysis

This project explores the Titanic dataset using Python. It follows a structured EDA process to extract insights about survival rates, passenger characteristics, and feature relationships.

## Task Breakdown

1. *Summary Statistics*: Used describe() and median() to explore central tendencies and distributions.
2. *Histograms & Boxplots*: Visualized Age and Fare with respect to survival.
3. *Correlation Matrix & Pairplots*: Analyzed relationships between numeric features.
4. *Trends & Patterns*: Identified survival trends based on Pclass, Sex, FamilySize, and Embarked.
5. *Feature-Level Inferences*: Computed survival rates across groups and created AgeGroup insights.

## Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## Files

- Titanic-Dataset.csv: Original dataset
- Task-2 Exploratory Data Analysis: Full Python script for EDA

## Output Examples

You can find visualizations like:
- Age and Fare distribution
- Correlation heatmap
- Survival rates by different categories
